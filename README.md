# Data Science Projects
This repository contains data cleaning, visualization, and analysis projects using datasets such as Google Play Store, TB burden, machinery goods, insurance, and more. Most work was done using Jupyter Notebook and R, applying various statistical methods like chi-square tests, linear regression, and categorical data analysis to test hypotheses.

### Shiny Assignment:

Developed a web application using the WHO TB dataset spanning late 1990s to early 2010s. The app features multiple interactive visualizations:

Histogram showing estimated TB prevalence (all forms) per 100,000 population

Density plot illustrating TB prevalence burden by region to highlight heavily affected areas

Barplot tracking TB prevalence distribution over time
This project has more to explore, and I look forward to deeper analysis and cleaning.


### Multivariate and Univariate Data Analysis:
Conducted in Jupyter Notebook using built-in datasets. Created five visualizations:

Scatterplot analyzing relationship between diamond carat and price

Jointplot expanding on carat-price relationship

Catplot showing diamond cut vs price with depth and color as additional dimensions (best visualization here)

Distplot and KDE plot for univariate analysis of dataset distributions (to be improved with more specific metrics like depth or cut)
This was an early project in R; I plan to refine these visualizations and analysis.


### LoanPTest:
Analyzed a loan dataset in Jupyter Notebook, focusing on applicant incomes, loan amounts, terms, and credit history.

Cleaned extreme values and handled missing data by imputing means

Used pivot tables to aggregate loan approval rates by credit history

Split data to build confusion matrices and calculate accuracy for loan approval prediction

Practiced dataset concatenation to enhance data manipulation skills


### Machine Learning Assignment:
Used RStudio with a housing dataset to perform basic analysis:

Summary statistics for different variables

Scatterplot comparing total rooms to total bedrooms

Barplot of population vs number of households


### Comparing Data Visualization: 
Analyzed countries.csv dataset in Jupyter Notebook filtering for Asia and Africa in 1952:

Histogram for life expectancy distribution in Asian and African countries

Scatterplot comparing life expectancy across continents (note: title had a technical error, but data corresponds to 1952)


### Real Estate Dataset Exploration:
Worked with realestate.csv in Jupyter Notebook applying filtering and cleaning methods such as .fillna(), .duplicated(), .drop_duplicates(), .mean(), etc.

These assignments were completed as part of The Tech Academy coursework. Much of the work still requires review and cleaning for clearer, more accurate results, which I plan to continue refining. Iâ€™m eager to learn and improve, so any advice from fellow analysts is greatly appreciated!
